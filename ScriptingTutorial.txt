In this text file I will teach you how to script for my text scripting engine.
It shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes to read and understand and should be
simple enough for just about anyone to follow.

Okay lets start with the basics. The way the text scripting engine works is
it parses your text and translates them to java via parsing. Each simple text
method has a larger more complicated method already written in java behind it.

First thing you should know and understand fully are loops as they are what makes
a script stable. For my text scripting engine looping is done easily with goto methods.
First you make a loop like so
@someloop:

now @someloop: will be our firt loop but we havn't added anything to this loop yet,
so it won't do anything.

Lets add some print to the client debug.

@someloop:
log(we are in our first loop!)

Now it will print out "we are in our first loop once and the script will end. Lets move
on to creating and using a second loop.

@someloop:
log(we are in our first loop!)
goto(@someotherloop:)

@someotherloop:
log(we are in our other loop!)

Now it will print out "we are in our first loop!" then it will jump to @someotherloop:
and print out "we are in our other loop!" then the script will stop. Now lets make these
2 loops actually loop.

@someloop:
log(we are in our first loop!)
goto(@someotherloop:)

@someotherloop:
log(we are in our other loop!)
goto(@someloop:)

Now it will keep printing "we are in our first loop!" and "we are in our other loop!"
over and over again in this order.

Now you should have the basics down on how this works so lets move on to the more advanced
scripting the requires the use of other methods.

In this simple script we walk to a tile location, then once we make it there we will walk
to another location and so on and so forth.

@someloop:
webwalkto(3336,4562,0)
gotoifplayernear(3336,4562,5,@someotherloop:) //if we are within 5 tiles of 3336,4562 it will
//move on to "@someotherloop:" and if not it will use goto(@someloop:) to return to the first line.
goto(@someloop:)

@someotherloop:
webwalkto(4356,1234,0)
gotoifplayernear(4356,1234,5,@someoloop:) //if we are within 5 tiles of 4356,1234 it will
//move on to "@someloop:" and if not it will use goto(@someotherloop:) to return to the first line
//of @someotherloop:
goto(@someloop:) //we didnt make it to our destination so lets go back to @someotherloop:


So our whole script will look like this

@someloop:
webwalkto(3336,4562,0)
gotoifplayernear(3336,4562,5,@someotherloop:)
goto(@someloop:)

@someotherloop:
webwalkto(4356,1234,0)
gotoifplayernear(4356,1234,5,@someotherloop:)
goto(@someloop:)

Now lets move on top gathering ID's that are essential (e.g. Screen Models, Item Id's, Etc.)

First open your TRiBoT RS3 Client and click "Debug", under this tab you can find "Screen Models"
when you check this tab there will be numbers next to everything. Each one of those numbers is a 
"Screen Model", grab the number for the Screen Model you want to interact with, you will need it later.
Now for inventory items you want to do the same thing as Screen Models but click Inventory, you want
to grab all the numbers from the start of the item until "R". For texture id's the easiest way is to
click "Tools" then click Texture tool. Now to grab you positions for walking and such click "Debug"
then "EGW Position" this will display your tile position.

The list of methods in this github is current and up to date. So I hope this helped, and enjoy!
